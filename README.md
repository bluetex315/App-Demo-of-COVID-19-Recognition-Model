# App-Demo-of-COVID-19-Recognition-Model
This project is about a COVID-19 voice recognition Android demo app built on the powerful PyTorch Mobile platform.

## Speech recognition
[Speech Recognition](https://github.com/bluetex315/App-Demo-of-COVID-19-Recognition-Model/tree/main/app/src/main/java/com/example/mlseriesdemo) demonstrates how to convert the ResNet to TorchScript and how to use the scripted model in an Android app to perform speech recognition.
